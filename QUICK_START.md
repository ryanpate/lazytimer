## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Steps)

### 1. Create Ad Units in AdSense
Log into https://www.adsense.google.com and create 3 ad units:
- "Top Banner" (Horizontal, Responsive)
- "Middle Display" (Auto, Responsive) 
- "Bottom Banner" (Horizontal, Responsive)

### 2. Replace Placeholder IDs
In all the HTML files, replace:
- `1234567890` with your Top Banner ad slot ID
- `2345678901` with your Middle Display ad slot ID  
- `3456789012` with your Bottom Banner ad slot ID

### 3. Rename & Upload Files
Rename the files (remove "-with-ads" from names) and upload to your server:
- `index-with-ads.html` → `index.html`
- `about-with-ads.html` → `about.html`
- etc.

### 4. Verify ads.txt
Make sure your existing `ads.txt` file is at your domain root:
```
https://lazytimer.com/ads.txt
```

### 5. Update Privacy Policy
Add a section about Google AdSense to your privacy policy (see full guide for text).
