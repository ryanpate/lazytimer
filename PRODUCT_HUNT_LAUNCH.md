Hey Product Hunt!

I built LazyTimer because I was frustrated with timer apps that:
- Required accounts/signups
- Were cluttered with ads
- Didn't work well on mobile
- Only did one thing

LazyTimer solves all of this:

🎯 **15 Specialized Timers** - Pomodoro, cooking, workout, meditation, study,
   egg timer, sleep timer, and more. Each optimized for its use case.

⏱️ **Beautiful Design** - Analog stopwatch + flip-clock display. Dark mode
   that's easy on the eyes.

📱 **Works Everywhere** - Desktop, tablet, phone. No app download needed.

🔊 **Smart Alerts** - Choose your alarm sound. Never miss when time's up.

🆓 **100% Free** - No accounts, no premium upsells, no BS.

I'd love your feedback! What timer features would make your life easier?

- Ryan

Title: I built a free Pomodoro timer with no signup required

Hey everyone! I've been using the Pomodoro technique for years and got
frustrated with timer apps that require accounts or push premium features.

So I built LazyTimer - it's completely free, works in the browser, and
has a dedicated Pomodoro page with the classic 25/5 intervals.

Also made specialized versions for cooking, workouts, studying, etc.

Just launched on Product Hunt today if anyone wants to check it out: [link]

Would love feedback on what features would make it more useful!
```

**r/Cooking**
```
Title: Free kitchen timer I built - no app download needed

Made a simple online kitchen timer with presets for common cooking times:
- Soft/hard boiled eggs
- Pasta
- Rice
- Baking times

Works on your phone, tablet, or computer. No signup, completely free.
